Software Developer  
---  

I used to be a teacher, but decided that wasn't the career for me. The great thing about developing software is it's possible if you have the time and energy! I spent two years of evenings, weekends, and holidays learning how to build websites and code using Python, and it paid off! I ended up getting a job using a variety of languages depending on what's needed, with lots of Python too! If you're currently in the process of making that career change I'd love to hear from you.

Currently living in Cornwall, UK (a beautiful part of the country and where I grew up). I took this photo. ðŸ‘‡
